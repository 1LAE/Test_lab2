In 1993, a survey was carried out in the Chios Straits by Dr. Cemal Pulak and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology.
During the survey, a number of shipwrecks were found, one of them being a Late Hellenistic Stone Carrier. 

Among the wreckage, 8 marble column drums with dimensions of 3 feet in height and 5-5.5 feet in diameter were found. 
Also found were a number of marble blocks, 6 blank gravestones, a number of roughly quarried marble basins and pedestals believed to 
be associated with one another, one corroded coin that is believed to be Greek, a double bladed axe head, an adze, 
a chisel and nail remover, metal cauldrons, ceramic jugs, bronze handles, cookware including undecorated plates and pans, 
fine Hellenistic tableware such as grey-ware, mold-made bowls, black glaze cups and bowls, and one example of a terracotta Herm 
figurine.
