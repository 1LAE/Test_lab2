Qt Creator is a cross-platform C++, JavaScript and QML integrated development 
environment which simplifies GUI application development. 
It is part of the SDK for the Qt 
GUI application development framework and uses 
the Qt API, which encapsulates host OS GUI function calls. 
It includes a visual debugger and an integrated WYSIWYG GUI layout and forms designer. 
The editor has features such as syntax 

highlighting and autocompletion. 
Qt Creator uses the C++ compiler from the GNU Compiler Collection on Linux and FreeBSD. On Windows it can use MinGW or MSVC with the default install and can also use Microsoft Console Debugger when 
compiled from source code. Clang is also 
supported.
